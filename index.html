          <p>Here you'll find a few ramblings about things that I am working on,
            or have worked on in the past.</p>
          <p>
            I'll try to bridge the gap between some of my passions,

          <p>
            My professional career has mostly been in software development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently I work for
            <a href="https://helcim.com" target="_blank">Helcim</a>,
            where I am a full stack developer.
            We are a payments company aimed at helping small businesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            After graduating university from U of C (Software Engineering),
            I worked for
            <a href="https://www.smarttech.com" target="_blank">
              SMART Technologies
            </a>â€” a company whose headquarters are in my home city â€”
            for a couple of years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Between then and now, I decided to make my own website/app:
          </p>
          <p class="desktop">
            You can learn more about if you click the "Music" heading.
          </p>
          <p class="mobile">
            You can learn more about it in the Software & Music section.

          <h2 class="mobile-header">
            Education
          </h2>
          <p>
            Teaching was probably my second choice as a major in university.
            Luckily, I have had opportunities to work it in to my life along
            the way. Notably, at a couple of awesome companies:
            Code Ninjas and School of Rock.

            I am an avid music lover, who has been a part of many projects,
            usually as a drummer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are a few albums that have made it far enough to be on the
            airwaves, all of which I wrote and recorded the drum parts.

            During COVID, I worked part time at
            <a href="https://www.codeninjas.com/" target="_blank">
              Code Ninjas
            </a>,
            which is an awesome company with a pretty straightforward mission.
            Teach kids how to write code.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am frankly quite surprised that programming is not taught much
            more heavily in school, especially junior high and high schools.
            This is a good segue to the next paragraph ...
          </p>
          <p>
            While I was in university, I volunteered for Schulich Ignite,
            which is an offshoot of Google Ignite.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ignitecs" target="_blank">
              Google Ignite
            </a>
            was an initiative aimed at making programming more accessible for
            those wanting to learn more. After a few years, the broader program
            fizzled out, but was survived by the remaining university club now
            called Schulich Ignite, at the University of Calgary.

            My first real solo software project is called Jukebox!

            Based on the "room" concept popularized by Jackbox,
            friends can simply join together via a room code
            and queue up songs of their choosing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I intend on adding more functionality in the future,
            such as SoundCloud and Apple Music.

            It was originally my friend Chris' idea, which I had the pleasure
            of making into a reality. I even got some help along the way,
            as he recently switched into software development himself!

            Probably the coolest job in the world, is working at
            <a href="https://www.schoolofrock.com" target="_blank">
              School of Rock
            </a>. the famous movie starring Jack Black is based off of the
            original school, not the other way around (a common mistake).
          </p>
          <p>
            School of Rock blends music and education in an awesome way through
            their unique group lessons, where we teach kids how to both be in a
            band and subsequently play shows!
          </p>
          <p>
            Teaching music was also my very first job, where I taught drums and
            guitar to kids in my community as a young teenager.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also need to use this space to endorse some of my favourite music
            education creators: Adam Neely, David Bennett, and 8-bit Music
            Theory, to name a few.

            Ah, the elusive music-software-education holy trinity.
            Maybe one day, I can teach people about some of the best music
            software that's out there.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have a music reading/writing background, you should 100%
            check out MuseScore. What they have slowly built over the years
            is mind-boggling, and it just keeps getting better and better!
            (and did I mention that it's free???)
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, if you're not classically trained, but are looking to mess
            around and make some music, I'd recommend a DAW like Ableton, or
            for Mac users, maybe GarageBand or ProTools.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's on my longer todo list, but I am currently building a
            synthesizer in C# that I plan on using to demonstrate some of the
            math behind music and music synthesis. I am basing some of my
            beginnings from this Microsoft blog.
